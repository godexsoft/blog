My colleague, Chris Ward, found a must share!

If you are programming for the iOS you will be really happy to
[read this](http://kevincupp.com/2011/05/12/symbolicating-ios-crash-logs.html).

It's amazing that the default Crash log format is completely unreadable.  
I'm wondering why Apple is not running the 'symbolicate' thingy on their logs before
giving them back to the developer? Anyway, hope you find it as useful as I did.

Cheers!
