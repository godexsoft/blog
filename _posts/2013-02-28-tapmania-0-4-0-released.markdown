After 3 months of work and 2 weeks of approval process, TapMania.org 0.4.0 is released to the AppStore!  

This new release features support for all resolutions.. iPads, iPhones, iPods. Everything.
Including all retina displays too.  
Also it has support for hardware controls via iCade and iControlPad.. and of course GameCenter.

There are 14 songs to play out of the box including several original songs by my mate Vospi.

Check it out [on itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapmania.org/id378830500).

Cheers.
