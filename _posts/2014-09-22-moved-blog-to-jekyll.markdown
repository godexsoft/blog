Recently I heard from my friend, Egor Ermakov, about octopress and jekyll.  
I really liked the idea of maintaining my blog with git and writing posts in any text editor i want
so i decided to move my blog (which i didn't use that much in the past years) to
octopress.

I found the HPSTR theme port for octopress and tried to get it to work but i failed miserably.
Therefore i decided to use jekyll instead. Jekyll worked just fine so that's what it's gonna be.

Importing posts from wordpress was a major PITA though. The importers are just dumping whatever you had
in your blog. In my case it was a bunch of HTML.. so I had to manually (well, almost. ended up writing a simple perl script)
update all my blog posts to make them look good again.

Anyway, hopefully this move will encourage me to start blogging again.

Cheers.
