Almost one month ago I started working on a new, cross-platform, game engine aimed on modern mobile platforms such as iOS and Android. The main language is (ta-daaaaa) C++, of course.
A couple of days ago I created a wiki which describes all of the high-level APIs available to developers using x2d (even though x2d is not open sourced yet :) ).
I already asked some of you in a personal email, however I would like to ask everyone who is reading this and who is interested to check out the wiki and let me know if you have any ideas/pointers regarding usability or design improvements for me to consider.

The wiki is located here: <a href="http://x2d.7bit.co">http://x2d.7bit.co</a>
Thanks in advance!

Cheers.
