Jill is basically a Lua implementation written from scratch using Java.  
Originally it was meant (I guess) for J2ME-enabled phones.

During my limited Blackberry development experience I had a chance to try Jill
out as it was already integrated.  
One thing to mention is that Jill has completely broken Lua's coroutine library.  
They seem to yield from within built-in functions like print and when they yield
you kinda loose control over your coroutines --- tadaa! the sample scheduler from the
"Programming in Lua" book is not working anymore.

Example code directly from Lua.org's online demo cgi which wont work with
Jill (coroutine.wrap fails) can be found at [lua.org's demo page](http://www.lua.org/cgi-bin/demo?sieve).

We probably will contact the authors of Jill and try to solve the issue together.  
Jill is a fast, simple and powerful tool to use when you have nothing better than
Java at your fingertips.  
In other words --- Jill is great unless you touch coroutines.

Cheers.
